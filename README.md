# NewsTexter

There are many students at Vanderbilt University, especially engineering majors, who rarely read the news. Much of the news is unimportant to students, who are too busy with schoolwork. They prefer things to be fast, which makes texting a great option. The goal of the NewsTexter project is to deliver to students the news they want to see through text to get them to be more invested, since most people get news on their phones. The language for this project will be Clojure, and the project will be adapted from the text messaging application made from CS 278.

A main feature that the NewsTexter project will include is a personal reader's digest text of news links each morning. After performing the interviews, it was clear that students take advantage of personalized news and the ability to subscribe to topics. This lets them receive relevant information that saves them time. Big news sites are the most trusted, so news will be pulled from them. Also, users may choose to see the first and last paragraphs of an article, as well as images that the article may have included. Interviews showed that users do not spend much time on articles and are satisifed with summaries.

Another main feature that this project will include is the ability to text a topic or query to find specific news. Interviews have also revealed that students will read articles when they know that other students have read the same articles. They like to view others' perspectives about an event or topic too. Therefore, users may also text to receive popular news articles, either determined by people online or other students. For any article, users can write comments that other students can choose to see, and they may do so anonymously to promote conversation and protect privacy.

images when deciding whether he should read more about a topic.

ignore the image and read the article. However the can sometimes capture his interest.

Peter: Images help Peter a lot in getting interested in topic. Visuals keep him invested in an article 
but he puts more value in the words. However images only supplement and can't replace words.
